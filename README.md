## server-mashup

Here, I will be posting various dockerized containers which allow you to run different servers. These servers will be communicating with each other, or atleast that is the plan for now. This may change in the future

## Steps

1. First, run the `init.sh` file which will create the docker network for you. This is the network where all your services will run. It will also run all the containers for you
